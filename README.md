The login form will be connected to a database, if the user id and password match the database entries, the user will login to the main form.
The Admin can go to the product form. He can add, edit, delete and view product stock.
The Admin can manage the different sellers which can sell products to clients.
Finally, the seller can sell products by using the Billing module and by printing the Bill to the client.
